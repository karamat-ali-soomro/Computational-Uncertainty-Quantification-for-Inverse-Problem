# Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems

This repository contains the implementation, methodology, and results of my Final Year Project titled **"Computational Uncertainty Quantification for Inverse Problems"**.

## Overview
Inverse problems are fundamental in various fields, from signal processing to medical imaging. This project focuses on reconstructing signals using Bayesian frameworks, with an emphasis on quantifying uncertainty through credible intervals.

## Features
- Forward modeling of inverse problems.
- Specification of priors using Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF).
- Likelihood definition and posterior sampling for reconstruction.
- Visualization of results, including MAP estimates and uncertainty quantification.
